        <p>Deep in the heart of the magical land of Silicon Valley, Men Jose, there was a brilliant and innovative product manager named Hanyu. She had years of experience and a mind full of cutting-edge ideas, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t catch a break.</p>
<p>Despite finishing a meister’s degree at the corn-wizards school of UIUC in 2022, Hanyu struggled to find a job matching her skills and experience. Everywhere she turned, she was met with rejection and disappointment. It seemed that something was always holding her back, no matter how hard she worked.</p>
<p>As she navigated the winding streets of Silicon Valley, she couldn’t help but feel like a stranger in a strange land, and that’s actually a fact. But her troubles were not just limited to finding a job - there was a giant monster lurking in the shadows, threatening to swallow up her hopes and dreams, called by locals as Mass Tech Layoff. It’s a brutal and merciless force that has claimed many victims, building up their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://layoffs.fyi/">graveyard</a>, and Hanyu knew that if she wasn’t careful, she could fall prey to its clutches someday and end up haunting this land without an H1B tombstone.</p>
<p>However, Hanyu refused to give up pursuing her dreams of working in this land of opportunity. She spent her days tirelessly applying for jobs and honing her skills. In the evenings, she would play Nintendo Switch games, for example, It Takes Two, Mario Kart 8, and Animal Crossing. etc., with her son, the cutest 7-year-old cowboy in this world, who possessed a magical power that helped keep her spirit high and her hopes alive, always to remind her how rational and patient people she would meet at work.</p>
<p>As the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, Hanyu’s determination began to pay off. With the help of her son and a group of friendly creatures, she found the strength to face Mass Tech Layoff head-on and emerge victorious. She eventually landed a job at a startup where she could put her skills to use and make a real impact. And with her newfound confidence and the support of her son and her friends, she knew that she could take on whatever challenges lay ahead in the magical land of Silicon Valley, even after waking up from her daydream and writing these down as my story on my blog. Nice to meet you!</p>
