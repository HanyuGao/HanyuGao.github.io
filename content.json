Another letter told me, your insurance company has denied the service in whole or part of as your responsibility After thinking a while, I remembered that on 05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022, I burnt my fingers with an oven tray one day and called Mckinley Health Center for help. Mckinley Emergency agent provided service options under my insurance coverage, and I went to Heart of Mary Medical center and received the cure. But why did my student’s insurance deny the coverage? Then I called the 24&#x2F;7 SAP number on my insurance card, 877-862-1172. The agent led me to the Student Resource at 800-767-0700, where agent Mel helped. She checked and explained patiently: OSF claimed to my insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, but at the same time, the Mckinley portal hadn’t activated the coverage for the summer semester (05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022 - 08&#x2F;19&#x2F;2022). Therefore, the solution is to reclaim. Mel submitted the form, and I got a document control number for OSF. Then I dialed OSF Healthcare at 309-683-6750. OSF also gave me another number for tracking their process, where I could dial 800-421-5700 to follow up, and usually, the bill should be covered in 20 business days. From receiving the letters to processing the resolution, it took me 30min, mostly waiting online within 5 calls, including 2 (&#x2F;5 calls) not helpful because of the broken phone system sometimes leading me nowhere with the instructions. It’s not a big deal for me, an immigrant student who has spent almost one year in America, dealing with this chore from time to time. However, those feelings for the first time hit my mind when I hung up the phone—the first time renting apartments in a city where I knew no one; the first time registering for the class on websites crashing all day; the first time calling emergency and going to the hospital wondering it would cost a fortune. I was once confused, worried, frustrated, and even scared at those first times. So I immediately opened my laptop and logged this “A story of resolving the denial of insurance.” If you’re someone in the same situation, somehow find my blog via keyword searching. I hope my information could help you there. Don’t panic. It’s not a big deal.","categories":[{"name":"Stories","slug":"Stories","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/Stories/"}],"tags":[{"name":"immigrant","slug":"immigrant","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/immigrant/"},{"name":"U of I","slug":"U-of-I","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/U-of-I/"},{"name":"UIUC","slug":"UIUC","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/UIUC/"},{"name":"student","slug":"student","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/student/"},{"name":"Diary","slug":"Diary","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Diary/"}]},{"title":"A Conversation, Q & A about my life","slug":"Life","date":"2022-05-09T02:24:23.000Z","updated":"2022-07-17T23:41:20.280Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/08/Life/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/05/08/Life/","excerpt":"","text":"Talk About Life I watched your vlog, which is full of humor and vitality, and I was shocked when I knew you were divorced and had to take care of a baby alone for years. How was your day? Back in Guangzhou, I worked from 10:30 AM – 6:30 PM, Mon-Fri, and I hired my nanny, who works from 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM, Mon-Sat. So my every weekday was restricted by 10 AM out and 7 PM back; I was like a prisoner of such a recurrent schedule. I appeased my son every morning, grabbed s.th to eat, and then went to work. After I returned from work, I rushed to have our dinner and then played with him the whole night. On weekends, I mostly had a rest on Saturday and took my kid to hang out on Sunday. It sounds so tough. How were you feeling? Yeah, it was too overwhelmed for me to balance. I felt like Edward Norton’s character in Fight Club who suffered from chronic insomnia. Sometimes I felt like a lifeless robot, inputting information and workflow, outputting words and actions. Sometimes I thought of myself as an energetic entrepreneur, funding to help cash flow, thus keeping our team (kid, nanny, and me) operating well. Luckily kid is not a business since he definitely grows and loves you back. Every day, I’ve been learning something new from him! That’s the bright side.

Community encourages runners to share and connect via posts. Club helps people create or join run clubs and activities. Races consist of races and virtual marathons. Business ModelMost features are for free. Revenue is earned from customers of sports companies like Adidas, Under Armour, or car companies like Buike. The sports companies seek data collecting, online distribution, event implementation, and ads among runners; the car companies are alike since marathon runners in China were in the big overlap market of car’s target customers.

So I was pleased to join and help the community by what I can do, like helping edit and organize general questions. For example, I directed many of the same questions to the older ones; thus, the valuable content could be gathered on one page that newcomers could quickly view. I kept doing such simple things until I got the COO’s invitation for the internship.
