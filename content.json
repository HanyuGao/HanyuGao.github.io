Much data was like a swirling vortex that got me lost. I tried “surfing” on “waves” but found the issue was my “board” – the data dashboard is not easy to learn insights. Then I redesigned and proposed the analytical data layers and persuaded engineers to implement them. Then it hit my mind, why not become a PM? Then I pivoted to PM, which got me out of bed on Monday easier. Over the 8 years of experience in product management, I dedicated myself to customers&#x2F;users to see a new future out of existing software or from nowhere: I’ve created a first-of-its-kind tracker that lets 30K+ soccer players see their performance data on mobile. I’ve built an online community from scratch that increased DAU by 13%. I enjoy learning new things and connecting with people across a range of industries, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to get in touch: &#x74;&#112;&#109;&#x2e;&#x6c;&#111;&#114;&#105;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;"}],"posts":[{"title":"Denial of insurance","slug":"Note of an little issue","date":"2022-07-11T23:20:58.000Z","updated":"2022-11-10T02:48:39.403Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/07/11/Note of an little issue/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/07/11/Note%20of%20an%20little%20issue/","excerpt":"","text":"I’m writing this note to help someone in the same situation who finds my blog via keyword searching.I hope my information could help you there. I was confused when I received a $252 bill from OSF health care. Another letter told me, your insurance company has denied the service in whole or part of as your responsibility After thinking a while, I remembered that on 05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022, I burnt my fingers with an oven tray one day and called Mckinley Health Center for help. Mckinley Emergency agent provided service options under my insurance coverage, and I went to Heart of Mary Medical center and received the cure. But why did my student’s insurance deny the coverage? Then I called the 24&#x2F;7 SAP number on my insurance card, 877-862-1172. The agent led me to the Student Resource at 800-767-0700, where agent Mel helped. She checked and explained patiently: OSF claimed to my insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, but at the same time, the Mckinley portal hadn’t activated the coverage for the summer semester (05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022 - 08&#x2F;19&#x2F;2022). Therefore, the solution is to reclaim. Mel submitted the form, and I got a document control number for OSF. Then I dialed OSF Healthcare at 309-683-6750. OSF also gave me another number for tracking their process, where I could dial 800-421-5700 to follow up, and usually, the bill should be covered in 20 business days. From receiving the letters to processing the resolution, it took me 30min, mostly waiting online within 5 calls, including 2 (&#x2F;5 calls) not helpful because of the broken phone system sometimes leading me nowhere with the instructions.","categories":[{"name":"Stories","slug":"Stories","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/Stories/"}],"tags":[{"name":"immigrant","slug":"immigrant","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/immigrant/"},{"name":"U of I","slug":"U-of-I","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/U-of-I/"},{"name":"UIUC","slug":"UIUC","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/UIUC/"},{"name":"student","slug":"student","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/student/"},{"name":"Diary","slug":"Diary","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Diary/"}]},{"title":"NVIDIA Inventory","slug":"NVIDIA","date":"2022-01-01T23:30:37.000Z","updated":"2022-11-10T02:48:18.501Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/01/01/NVIDIA/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/01/01/NVIDIA/","excerpt":"","text":"Turnover Year NVIDIA’s Turnover 2013 5.5x 2014 4.7x 2015 4.8x 2016 4.9x 2017 4.7x 2018 4.9x 2019 3.8x 2020 3.2x 2021 4.4x 2022 4.3x Companies Turnover in 2022 NVIDIA 4.3x QUALCOMM 4.5x AMD 4.7x Microsoft 21.7x Data above was from Source NVIDIA takes 84.88 average days to sell the inventory in a year, while Microsoft only takes 21.7 days.
