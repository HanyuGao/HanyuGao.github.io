Much data was like a swirling vortex that got me lost. I tried “surfing” on “waves” but found the issue was my “board” – the data dashboard is not easy to learn insights. Then I redesigned and proposed the analytical data layers and persuaded engineers to implement them. Then it hit my mind, why not become a PM? Then I pivoted to PM, which got me out of bed on Monday easier. Over the 8 years of experience in product management, I dedicated myself to customers&#x2F;users to see a new future out of existing software or from nowhere: I’ve created a first-of-its-kind tracker that lets 30K+ soccer players see their performance data on mobile. I’ve built an online community from scratch that increased DAU by 13%. I enjoy learning new things and connecting with people across a range of industries, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to get in touch: &#116;&#112;&#x6d;&#46;&#108;&#111;&#114;&#x69;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;"}],"posts":[{"title":"My Vlogs","slug":"Analytics","date":"2022-11-15T20:41:33.000Z","updated":"2022-11-16T02:24:24.488Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/15/Analytics/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/11/15/Analytics/","excerpt":"","text":"I’ve always wanted to learn something new for fun and am interested in video editing. So I made a plan to post 5 vlogs every year since I didn’t like myself to be so rushed or transactional, which might ruin my passion as a beginner. Four years passed, and I made 20 vlogs by CapCut or Final Cut Pro. 17 were in Chinese, and 3 were in English after I began to have new friends from other cultures. I had fun; surprisingly, my friends loved my vlogs, too. This is the vlog we were talking about Today I was suddenly curious about the data, so I gathered them from each post and summarized as below: Updated date: Nov.15, 2022, Data were from WeChat, and Instagram Not included data of 1 video posted on Youtube Total Year Posts Views Likes Comments Shares 2019 5 1955 13 1 4 2020 6 7736 114 22 8 2021 4 2926 38 9 35 2022 5 4842 116 22 21 PopularityPosts popularity varies with views ranging from 870 to 5300 and likes ranging from 0 to 92;5 most popular posts were all 1k+ views, 5.2k, 2.5k, 1.4k, 1.2k, and 1k with average each 30+ likes. EngagementMy average like-to-view ratio is 2%, 2 likes to 100 views, which increased from 1%; According to Google, above 4% is considered above average or good. So, here is my new plan: Continue to make 5 vlogs this year; See when I can make a 4%+ like-to-view video.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"--","slug":"Shame","date":"2022-11-12T17:19:16.000Z","updated":"2022-11-16T02:25:34.257Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/12/Shame/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/11/12/Shame/","excerpt":"","text":"Until yesterday a meaningful conversation, I had never thought a few of my weaknesses stemmed from the emotion of shame, working on which could help with my procrastination.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"おわり","slug":"Speechless","date":"2022-11-10T03:07:56.000Z","updated":"2022-11-12T07:56:08.648Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/09/Speechless/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/11/09/Speechless/","excerpt":"","text":"meme 竟然可以违反法律法规","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Denial of insurance","slug":"Note of an little issue","date":"2022-07-11T23:20:58.000Z","updated":"2022-11-12T07:53:23.932Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/07/11/Note of an little issue/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/07/11/Note%20of%20an%20little%20issue/","excerpt":"","text":"I’m writing this note to help someone in the same situation who finds my blog via keyword searching.I hope my information could help you there. I was confused when I received a $252 bill from OSF health care. Another letter told me, your insurance company has denied the service in whole or part of as your responsibility After thinking a while, I remembered that on 05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022, I burnt my fingers with an oven tray one day and called Mckinley Health Center for help. Mckinley Emergency agent provided service options under my insurance coverage, and I went to Heart of Mary Medical center and received the cure. But why did my student’s insurance deny the coverage? Then I called the 24&#x2F;7 SAP number on my insurance card, 877-862-1172. The agent led me to the Student Resource at 800-767-0700, where agent Mel helped. She checked and explained patiently: OSF claimed to my insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, but at the same time, the Mckinley portal hadn’t activated the coverage for the summer semester (05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022 - 08&#x2F;19&#x2F;2022). Therefore, the solution is to reclaim. Mel submitted the form, and I got a document control number for OSF. Then I dialed OSF Healthcare at 309-683-6750. OSF also gave me another number for tracking their process, where I could dial 800-421-5700 to follow up, and usually, the bill should be covered in 20 business days. From receiving the letters to processing the resolution, it took me 30min, mostly waiting online within 5 calls, including 2 (&#x2F;5 calls) not helpful because of the broken phone system sometimes leading me nowhere with the instructions.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"BQ Questions","slug":"BQ","date":"2022-05-06T21:41:00.383Z","updated":"2022-11-12T07:56:18.313Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/06/BQ/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/05/06/BQ/","excerpt":"","text":"Dive Deep Tell me about a specific metric you used to identify a need for a change in your department.
