It was a running data platform in China founded in 2014. In 2014, the Chinese government changed the regulation of the sport, encouraging private enterprises to host sports games, which was prohibited before. Many companies flushed into the sports industry. Joyrun is one of the companies seeking a fortune in the running market, considering runner was the most extensive segmentation for its easy accessibility for ordinary people to engage in. FeaturesJoyrun provided four main sections in the product: tool, community, clubs, and games. Tool refers to functions tracking and displaying sports data. Community encourages runners to share and connect via posts. Club helps people create or join run clubs and activities. Races consist of races and virtual marathons. Business ModelMost features are for free. Revenue is earned from customers of sports companies like Adidas, Under Armour, or car companies like Buike. The sports companies seek data collecting, online distribution, event implementation, and ads among runners; the car companies are alike since marathon runners in China were in the big overlap market of car’s target customers. In a word, it’s a three-sided B2B2C business.","categories":[{"name":"PM","slug":"PM","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/PM/"},{"name":"History","slug":"PM/History","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/PM/History/"}],"tags":[{"name":"To be cont'd","slug":"To-be-cont-d","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/To-be-cont-d/"},{"name":"PM","slug":"PM","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/PM/"},{"name":"Joyrun","slug":"Joyrun","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Joyrun/"},{"name":"Startup","slug":"Startup","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Startup/"},{"name":"Organization","slug":"Organization","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Organization/"},{"name":"Team Culture","slug":"Team-Culture","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Team-Culture/"}]},{"title":"Business Model Matters","slug":"OpenPlay","date":"2022-04-02T21:41:00.000Z","updated":"2022-05-06T22:36:39.249Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/02/OpenPlay/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/04/02/OpenPlay/","excerpt":"","text":"","categories":[{"name":"PM","slug":"PM","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/PM/"},{"name":"History","slug":"PM/History","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/categories/PM/History/"}],"tags":[{"name":"PM","slug":"PM","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/PM/"},{"name":"Startup","slug":"Startup","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Startup/"},{"name":"OpenPlay","slug":"OpenPlay","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/OpenPlay/"},{"name":"Prototype","slug":"Prototype","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/tags/Prototype/"}]},{"title":"First Working was for my favorite Product","slug":"Career","date":"2022-04-02T00:05:11.000Z","updated":"2022-05-06T22:41:45.824Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/01/Career/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/04/01/Career/","excerpt":"","text":"When I was a senior, I started working at Tech, a startup building a Quora-like site called Zhihu, which would catapult the Internet and establish its knowledge-sharing platform dominance in China for years to come. I was obsessed with Zhihu since the community was for me. As a student curious about how society cooperates while didn’t have the working experience, I was inspired by reading Zhihu’s content, the majority of which was first-hand knowledge and insight from early adopters who are investors and Internet professionals. The vibe is friendly. No matter who you are, you can equally give voices on the topic; the audience was always willing to turn it into a constructive conversation. It was how I pictured what the Hyde Park speakers’ corner would be like in China online. I can’t help contributing in my way, such as editing and organizing general questions and directing the same upcoming questions to the older ones to gather valuable content and help newcomers connect. I contributed voluntarily daily, and soon I got the invite from the COO for the internship. Energized by being aboard, I viewed Zhihu less; more time was spent thinking about how to grow its impact outside the site and test our trials. My mentor and colleagues, who named ourselves”pirates,” are equally passionate, which made me feel connected and growing fast by learning from the collective intelligence working at their best. I was assigned to report data derived from iTunes Connect, Google Analytics, and API.
