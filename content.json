I was confused when I received a $252 bill from OSF health care. Another letter told me, your insurance company has denied the service in whole or part of as your responsibility After thinking a while, I remembered that on 05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022, I burnt my fingers with an oven tray one day and called Mckinley Health Center for help. Mckinley Emergency agent provided service options under my insurance coverage, and I went to Heart of Mary Medical center and received the cure. But why did my student’s insurance deny the coverage? Then I called the 24&#x2F;7 SAP number on my insurance card, 877-862-1172. The agent led me to the Student Resource at 800-767-0700, where agent Mel helped. She checked and explained patiently: OSF claimed to my insurance provider, UnitedHealthcare, but at the same time, the Mckinley portal hadn’t activated the coverage for the summer semester (05&#x2F;14&#x2F;2022 - 08&#x2F;19&#x2F;2022). Therefore, the solution is to reclaim. Mel submitted the form, and I got a document control number for OSF. Then I dialed OSF Healthcare at 309-683-6750. OSF also gave me another number for tracking their process, where I could dial 800-421-5700 to follow up, and usually, the bill should be covered in 20 business days. From receiving the letters to processing the resolution, it took me 30min, mostly waiting online within 5 calls, including 2 (&#x2F;5 calls) not helpful because of the broken phone system sometimes leading me nowhere with the instructions.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"BQ Questions","slug":"BQ","date":"2022-05-06T21:41:00.383Z","updated":"2022-11-12T07:56:18.313Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/06/BQ/","link":"","permalink":"https://hanyugao.github.io/2022/05/06/BQ/","excerpt":"","text":"Dive Deep Tell me about a specific metric you used to identify a need for a change in your department.
